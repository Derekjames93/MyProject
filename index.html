    <p> I am a 26 year old aspiring software engineer who is taking a leap of faith in order to achieve my dreams of being
      a professional programmer. This decision was very difficult for me but with the guidance of my family and friends
      it was a choice I realized I had to make. Some of my hobbies are watching anime, playing video games, and hanging
      with friends.
    </p>
    
    <p>These things were important for me to have to start my Journey</p>
